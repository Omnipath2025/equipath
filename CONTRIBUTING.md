## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

**TypeScript/JavaScript**
// Use explicit types and comprehensive interfaces
interface VerificationParams {
contributionHash: string;
culturalContext: string;
qualityThreshold: number;
expectedAttributes: string;
}

// Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation
/**

@dev Generate zero-knowledge proof for knowledge contribution

@param contribution Knowledge contribution data

@param params Verification parameters

@returns ZK proof object

@throws {CircuitError} When proof generation fails
*/
public async generateProof(
contribution: KnowledgeContribution,
params: VerificationParams
): Promise<ZKProof> {
// Implementation with proper error handling
}


**Solidity Contracts**
/**

@title EquiPathVerifier

@dev ESP Grant Deliverable: Core verification contract

@notice Privacy-preserving verification for traditional knowledge
*/
contract EquiPathVerifier {
/// @dev Clear documentation for all functions
/// @param contributionHash Hash of the contribution
/// @return success True if verification successful
function verifyContribution(
bytes32 contributionHash,
bytes32 culturalContext,
bytes32 attributionProof
) external returns (bool success) {
// Gas-optimized implementation with proper validation
}
}

**Circuit Development**
/*

@title KnowledgeVerification

@dev Privacy-preserving verification circuit

@notice Proves knowledge ownership without content disclosure
*/
template KnowledgeVerification(maxKnowledgeLength, maxContextLength) {
// Clear signal definitions and constraints
signal input contributionHash;
signal private input knowledgeContent[maxKnowledgeLength];
signal output verified;

// Well-documented constraint logic
}

### Testing Requirements

**Minimum Coverage: 80%**
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Security tests for potential vulnerabilities
- Performance tests for gas optimization

**Test Structure**
describe('EquiPathVerifier', () => {
describe('generateProof', () => {
it('should generate valid proof for authentic knowledge', async () => {
// Arrange: Set up test data
// Act: Execute function
// Assert: Verify results
});
it('should throw ValidationError for invalid input', async () => {
  // Test error conditions
});});
});

### Security Guidelines

**Smart Contract Security**
- Follow OpenZeppelin security patterns
- Implement proper access controls
- Use reentrancy guards where appropriate
- Validate all inputs and state transitions

**Circuit Security**
- Ensure zero-knowledge properties are maintained
- Validate all constraint logic
- Test for potential information leakage
- Implement proper random number generation

**SDK Security**
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- Implement secure key management patterns
- Use proper cryptographic libraries
- Handle sensitive data appropriately
