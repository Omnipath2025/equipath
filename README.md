# EquiPath: Privacy-Preserving Traditional Knowledge Protection
**Digital Rights Platform for Indigenous Community Sovereignty**

🏛️ **Cloak & Quill Research** - 501(c)(3) Public Charity  
🎯 **Mission:** Protect traditional knowledge through cryptographic privacy while ensuring community control and fair compensation

## 🚨 The Crisis: Digital Colonization of Indigenous Knowledge

**4.5 billion traditional knowledge holders worldwide face systematic digital exploitation:**
- **Pharmaceutical companies** extract traditional remedies without compensation
- **AI systems** train on indigenous knowledge without consent
- **Research institutions** publish traditional practices without attribution
- **Tech platforms** monetize cultural knowledge while communities remain in poverty

**The result:** Digital colonization that perpetuates centuries of knowledge theft.
