# EquiPath: Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Verification System


## Project Overview

EquiPath implements a zero-knowledge verification system for traditional medicinal knowledge contributions, enabling fair compensation while protecting intellectual property and cultural privacy. Using zk-SNARKs on Ethereum, we create verifiable proofs of contribution without revealing sensitive knowledge details.

This breakthrough enables indigenous communities and traditional knowledge holders to receive equitable compensation for their knowledge while maintaining control over their cultural heritage and intellectual property.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains technical documentation for OmniPath's EquiPath zk-SNARK verification system, submitted as part of the Ethereum Foundation Small Grants application:

- [Technical Implementation Plan](./technical_implementation_plan.md): Detailed architecture and implementation approach
- [Budget Breakdown](./budget_breakdown.md): Allocation of requested funds across development areas
- [Project Timeline](./project_timeline.md): Development milestones and delivery schedule

## Key Technical Components

EquiPath's verification system consists of three primary components:

### 1. Off-chain Proof Generation
- Circom-based circuit designs for knowledge contribution verification
- Privacy-preserving knowledge representation
- Efficient proving key generation and proof creation

### 2. On-chain Verification
- Gas-optimized verification contracts
- Integration with Ethereum mainnet/L2 solutions
- Smart contract-based contribution registry

### 3. Fair Compensation Distribution
- Privacy-preserving compensation claims
- Integration with token governance systems
- Transparent yet private attribution mechanisms

## Ethereum Integration

EquiPath leverages Ethereum's infrastructure in several ways:

- **Smart Contract Security**: Enabling trustless verification and compensation
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implementing privacy-preserving verification on-chain
- **Decentralized Governance**: Token-based decision making for system parameters
- **Public Good Infrastructure**: Creating ethical pathways for knowledge sharing

## Broader OmniPath Ecosystem

EquiPath is one component of the broader OmniPath ecosystem, which integrates:

- **EthnoPath**: Capture and digitization of traditional medicinal knowledge
- **FundPath**: Token-based governance and resource allocation
- **GenomePath**: Genomic validation of traditional medicinal knowledge
- **MetaPath**: Orchestration across the entire OmniPath ecosystem

The current grant application focuses specifically on the privacy-preserving verification layer, which will remain open-source regardless of the commercial direction of other system components.

## Alignment with Ethereum Ecosystem Values

EquiPath advances several core values of the Ethereum ecosystem:

1. **Privacy as a Right**: Implementing advanced privacy techniques while enabling verification
2. **Equitable Participation**: Creating pathways for marginalized knowledge contributors
3. **Public Goods Innovation**: Developing open infrastructure for ethical knowledge sharing
4. **Technical Innovation**: Pushing the boundaries of zero-knowledge applications
