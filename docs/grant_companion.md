# EquiPath: Ethereum Foundation Small Grant Companion Document

## Executive Summary

EquiPath develops open-source zero-knowledge proof infrastructure enabling privacy-preserving verification of traditional knowledge contributions. This public good allows indigenous communities and knowledge holders to prove the value of their contributions without revealing sensitive details, enabling fair compensation while protecting cultural heritage.

## Alignment with Ethereum Ecosystem Values

- Designed for community ownership and governance

### 2. **Privacy as a Fundamental Right**
- First implementation of zk-SNARKs for traditional knowledge
- Enables verification without disclosure
- Protects vulnerable communities from exploitation

### 3. **Technical Innovation**
- Novel application of Groth16/PLONK to social impact
- Gas-optimized verification contracts
- Offline-first proof generation for remote communities

### 4. **Inclusivity & Accessibility**
- Multi-language support in client libraries
- Low-bandwidth optimization
- No technical knowledge required for end users

- Tutorial videos

## Budget Allocation

| Category | Amount | Justification |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| zk-SNARK Development | $12,000 | Specialized cryptographic expertise |
| Smart Contracts | $10,000 | Security-critical infrastructure |
| Client SDK | $5,000 | Accessibility for non-technical users |
| Documentation | $3,000 | Essential for adoption |
| **Total** | **$30,000** | |

## Success Metrics

1. **Technical Metrics**
   - Gas cost < 500,000 per verification
   - Proof generation < 30 seconds
   - Support for 10+ knowledge attribute types

2. **Adoption Metrics**
   - 5+ projects building on EquiPath within 6 months
   - 100+ knowledge contributions verified
   - 3+ traditional communities engaged

3. **Ecosystem Impact**
   - Referenced in 3+ research papers
   - Integrated by 2+ DAOs
   - Forked/extended by community

## Long-term Sustainability

### Open Source Governance
- Community-driven development post-grant
- Transparent decision-making process
- No single entity control

### Ecosystem Integration
- Standard interfaces for broad compatibility
- Modular design for extensibility
- Chain-agnostic architecture

### Funding Model
- Grant covers core infrastructure
- Community/DAO funding for maintenance
- Optional paid support services (separate entity)

## Why This Matters

Traditional knowledge represents millennia of human wisdom currently at risk of:
- Exploitation without compensation
- Loss due to lack of preservation incentives
- Appropriation by commercial entities

EquiPath provides the technical infrastructure to:
- Verify knowledge without revealing it
- Enable fair compensation
- Preserve cultural heritage
- Bridge traditional and modern systems

## Technical Innovation

### Novel Contributions to Ethereum Ecosystem

1. **First zk-SNARK implementation for social impact**
   - Extends ZK usage beyond financial privacy
   - Creates new paradigm for knowledge verification

2. **Gas-optimized verification patterns**
   - Batch verification techniques
   - Precompiled contract utilization
   - L2 optimization strategies

3. **Accessibility-first ZK design**
   - Simplified proof generation
   - Multi-modal interfaces
   - Offline-capable architecture

## Call to Action

We invite the Ethereum community to:
- Review and contribute to our code
- Test circuits with diverse use cases
- Provide feedback on interfaces
- Build applications on our infrastructure

Together, we can create a more equitable system for knowledge sharing and preservation.
