## Budget Justification

The budget allocation prioritizes the core technical implementation while ensuring appropriate resources for security, testing, and documentation:

- **Smart Contract Development (58.3%)**: The largest allocation reflects the complexity of implementing secure, gas-efficient contracts for verification and compensation.

- **zk-SNARK Circuit Design (25.0%)**: Specialized expertise required for designing and optimizing zk-SNARK circuits that balance privacy requirements with verification efficiency.

- **Security Audit & Testing (10.0%)**: Critical for ensuring the privacy guarantees and security properties of the system.

- **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing (6.7%)**: Essential for ecosystem adoption and educational value to the broader Ethereum community.

## Additional Resources & Contributions

Beyond the requested grant funding, the project benefits from:

- Pre-existing OmniPath codebase and architecture
- Technical advisors providing in-kind consultation
- Integration with other OmniPath modules (EthnoPath, FundPath)
