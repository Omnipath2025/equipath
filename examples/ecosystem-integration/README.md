# EquiPath Ecosystem Integration Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how developers can build ethical applications using EquiPath's privacy-preserving traditional knowledge verification infrastructure.

## üéØ Purpose

These examples showcase:
- **Privacy-First Integration**: How to verify traditional knowledge without cultural exploitation
- **Ethical Development Patterns**: Best practices for respectful knowledge sharing
- **Community Empowerment**: How EquiPath enables community control over their knowledge
- **Ecosystem Potential**: The variety of applications EquiPath enables

## üìã Integration Examples

### 1. Pharmaceutical Ethical Sourcing (`pharmaceutical-ethical-sourcing.ts`)

**Use Case**: Pharmaceutical companies verifying traditional medicinal knowledge contributions

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Zero-knowledge verification without revealing cultural secrets
- ‚úÖ Automatic fair compensation calculation and distribution
- ‚úÖ Cultural boundary enforcement and compliance tracking
- ‚úÖ Audit trails for regulatory requirements

**Who Can Use**: Pharmaceutical companies, biotech firms, research institutions

**Impact**: Prevents biopiracy while enabling ethical innovation and fair compensation

### 2. Academic Research Platform (`academic-research-platform.ts`)

**Use Case**: Universities and researchers collaborating across cultures ethically

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Proper attribution verification before publication
- ‚úÖ Cultural sensitivity validation for research proposals
- ‚úÖ Automatic compensation for knowledge contributors
- ‚úÖ Cross-institutional collaboration with privacy protection

**Who Can Use**: Universities, research institutions, academic publishers, graduate students

**Impact**: Enables ethical cross-cultural research while respecting indigenous knowledge rights

### 3. Community Cultural Preservation (`community-cultural-preservation.ts`)

**Use Case**: Traditional knowledge communities controlling their own knowledge sharing

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Community-governed access controls and permissions
- ‚úÖ Elder approval systems for sensitive knowledge
- ‚úÖ Compensation preference management
- ‚úÖ Usage monitoring and community governance

**Who Can Use**: Indigenous communities, cultural organizations, knowledge keepers

**Impact**: Empowers communities with technical tools for knowledge sovereignty

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Integration Pattern

All examples follow this privacy-preserving pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Initialize EquiPath with appropriate settings
const verifier = new EquiPathVerifier({
  network: 'polygon', // or 'ethereum'
  privacyLevel: 'maximum',
  culturalProtection: true
});

// 2. Verify without revealing sensitive information
const verification = await verifier.verifyWithoutReveal({
  proof: zkProof,
  culturalBoundaries: communitySettings,
  intendedUse: 'research' // or 'commercial', 'academic'
});

// 3. Trigger ethical compensation automatically
if (verification.isValid) {
  await initiateEthicalCompensation(verification.attribution);
}
Privacy Guarantees

Zero Knowledge: Cultural knowledge content never revealed on-chain
Community Control: Knowledge holders maintain full control over access
Cultural Boundaries: Technical enforcement of sacred knowledge protection
Audit Transparency: Complete compensation and usage tracking
